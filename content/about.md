{{% photo src="/img/me.png" alt="Me" %}}

I'm a full stack engineer currently stationed in Zagreb, Croatia, I've been working in the industry since 2014. My main stack is based on Elixir, usually paired with Phoenix and PostgreSQL, Absinthe if GraphQL is needed. I'm also experienced with Javascript, using it both on frontend and backend, but lately I'm preferring Typescript more and more which improves the developer experience for me and makes the codebase saner.

I'm always looking for freelancing opportunities and fun projects to work on. If you think we could work together you can check my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davor-badrov-670b0312b/) and reach out there. I'm also part of the Toptal team, you can see my profile [here](https://www.toptal.com/resume/davor-badrov).
